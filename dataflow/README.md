# Past2Present

Convert past tense sentences to present. Create a dataset of the form
```
< This was a sentence.
> This is a sentence.
...
```
It preprocesses text files before extracting their sentences. The preprocessing is specially designed to work with plain text files from the Gutenberg project, and removes things like footnotes and character prompts in plays.
