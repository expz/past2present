# Raw Data

Put documents to parse here. So that they can be split into chunks and processed in smaller sizes, make sure the documents have a blank line at least every 10,000 lines or so.

For example, put books from project Gutenberg with the legal and other parts added by Gutenberg (as well indices) removed.

An example book is included.
