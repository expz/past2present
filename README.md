# Past2Present

This project has two main functions:

1. Build a dataset of sentences in their original form and transformed to present tense if they were past tense, e.g.
  ```
  < There was a boy.
  > There is a boy
  ```

2. Train a neural network to perform the translation from past to present directly (and preserve sentences which are not in past tense).
